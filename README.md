## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

_I've always been fascinated by Pop Art, where artists use radical and innovative means to create their works. I was most inspired by Andy warhol's photographic silkscreen print technique and Roy Lichtenstein's Benday dot paintings. Their use of constrating colours, repetitive lines and dots, and the interplay of bright and shadow create impressive and dynamic works. Incorporating these techniques into our assignment can enhance the animation's texture, as well as add movements and depths of the original artwork, making it more visually interactive and engaging._
